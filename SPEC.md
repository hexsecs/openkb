# OpenShelf Specification — v0.1 (draft)

OpenShelf standardizes the **LLM Wiki** pattern described by Andrej Karpathy
([gist](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)).
In that pattern, an LLM incrementally builds and maintains a persistent,
interlinked set of Markdown pages between you and your raw sources, instead of
re-deriving everything from the sources at query time.

The gist is deliberately abstract, and people organize their wikis in very
different ways. OpenShelf keeps that freedom. It standardizes only what another
tool or project needs in order to **connect** to a KB:

- **The contract (§2–§6)** is small and strict. It says where things are, how
  pages are identified and summarized, and how links work. Every conforming KB
  meets it, so any number of KBs can be connected to one project.
- **The conventions (§7–§9)** are recommendations: a default layout, page
  types, operations and profiles. Follow them, change them or ignore them; a
  KB stays compatible as long as it meets the contract.

The key words MUST, SHOULD and MAY are used as in RFC 2119. They apply only
in the contract sections; the convention sections are non-normative unless a
KB opts into a profile (§9).

---

## 1. Design principles

1. **Declare, don't dictate.** A KB says in its manifest where its pages,
   index and sources are. Consumers read the manifest instead of assuming a
   layout.
2. **Progressive context.** Every KB offers the same tiers of detail (§3), so
   an agent connected to many KBs loads only as much as a task needs.
3. **Plain files.** Markdown with YAML frontmatter in a directory, usually a
   git repository. Readable without tools, and works in Obsidian.

---

# Part I — Compatibility contract

## 2. Manifest — `kb.yaml`

A KB is a directory with a `kb.yaml` file at its root. This file is the only
fixed path in the spec.

```yaml
openshelf: "0.1"                 # REQUIRED  spec version
id: awesome-can-bus           # REQUIRED  [a-z0-9-], unique per publisher
title: Awesome CAN bus        # REQUIRED
description: >                # REQUIRED  L0 text, ≤ 300 chars
  Curated tools and libraries for working with CAN bus...

layout:                       # OPTIONAL  where things are; defaults shown
  pages: wiki                 #   directory holding pages (searched recursively)
  index: index.md             #   L1 entry point
  sources: raw                #   raw sources, if kept in the KB
  schema: AGENTS.md           #   instructions for the maintainer LLM
  log: log.md                 #   activity log

types: {}                     # OPTIONAL  custom page types, see §4.3
profile: wiki                 # OPTIONAL  see §9
version: 2026.10.31           # OPTIONAL
license: CC-BY-4.0            # SHOULD    SPDX id for the content; CC-BY-4.0 recommended
maintainers: [hexsecs]        # SHOULD
tags: [can, automotive]       # OPTIONAL
depends: []                   # OPTIONAL  ids of KBs this one links into
```

If `license` is absent, consumers MUST NOT assume one. `openshelf init` uses
CC-BY-4.0 unless told otherwise.

All `layout` paths are relative to the KB root and MUST NOT point outside it.
Consumers MUST use the declared paths and the defaults above for any that
are missing. `layout.pages` MAY be `.` for a KB whose pages sit at the root.

Fields not defined here are allowed and MUST be ignored by consumers that
don't understand them. Tool-specific settings SHOULD go under an `x-<tool>`
key.

Schema: [`schemas/kb.schema.json`](schemas/kb.schema.json).

## 3. Context tiers

| Tier | Comes from               | Budget (guide)          | When it is loaded                  |
|------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| L0   | `description`            | ≤ 300 characters        | Always, for every connected KB     |
| L1   | `layout.index`           | ≤ 4,000 tokens          | When a task touches the KB's scope |
| L2   | a page                   | ≤ 2,000 tokens per page | When that page is relevant         |
| L3   | `layout.sources` or URLs | unbounded               | Only to verify or extend a page    |

Consumers MUST be able to work from L0 alone and MUST NOT load L1+ of a KB
just because it is connected. Producers SHOULD respect the budgets.

## 4. Pages

A **page** is any `.md` file under `layout.pages`, except:

- the files declared as `layout.index`, `layout.schema` and `layout.log`,
  and anything under `layout.sources`;
- sub-indexes: files with no frontmatter that are linked from the index (or
  from another sub-index) and that themselves contain links;
- files and directories whose name starts with `_` or `.`. Directories inside
`layout.pages` are free-form: organize by type, topic, date or not at all.

### 4.1 Identity

A page's **id** is its path relative to `layout.pages`, without `.md`, using
`/` as the separator: `entities/python-can`, or just `python-can` in a flat
layout. Ids are what links and other KBs use, so renaming or moving a page
SHOULD leave a redirect (§4.4).

### 4.2 Frontmatter

Pages MUST have YAML frontmatter with these fields:

| Field     | Rule                                                              |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`   | REQUIRED                                                          |
| `summary` | REQUIRED, ≤ 160 chars, one sentence; what the index and search show |

And SHOULD have:

| Field     | Rule                                                              |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`    | A page type, see §4.3                                             |
| `updated` | Date of last substantive change (`YYYY-MM-DD`)                    |
| `sources` | List of `{url or path, retrieved}` backing the page's claims      |

Any other fields (`tags`, `aliases`, `related`, Dataview fields, profile
fields) are allowed and ignored by consumers that don't understand them.

Schema: [`schemas/page.schema.json`](schemas/page.schema.json).

### 4.3 Page types

`type` is free text, so a KB can use whatever types suit its domain. The
**core types** in §8.2 have shared meanings, and a KB SHOULD use them where
they fit. A KB that uses other types SHOULD declare them in `kb.yaml`, so
consumers and other maintainers know what they mean:

```yaml
types:
  decision: A choice that was made, with the alternatives and the reasoning.
  recipe: Step-by-step instructions for one task.
```

### 4.4 Links

Inside a KB, pages MAY use either style; consumers MUST resolve both:

- **Markdown links** with relative paths: `[cantools](cantools.md)`.
- **Wikilinks**: `[[cantools]]`, `[[entities/cantools]]` or
  `[[cantools|label]]`. A wikilink resolves to the page whose id matches; if
  none does, to the only page with that file name; otherwise it is ambiguous
  and lint SHOULD flag it.

Links **to another KB** use `kb://<kb-id>/<page-id>`. Consumers resolve them
only when that KB is connected, and otherwise show the link text.

A moved page MAY leave a stub at its old path with `redirect: <new-id>` in its
frontmatter and no body. Consumers MUST follow it.

## 5. Index

`layout.index` is the L1 entry point and the first thing an agent reads after
L0. It is Markdown, organized however the KB likes, but:

- Every page MUST be reachable from it, either directly or through
  sub-indexes it links to. Lint SHOULD report pages that aren't.
- Each page link SHOULD be followed by that page's `summary`, so the index
  works as a catalog without opening pages.
- If the KB is too large for the L1 budget, the index SHOULD link to
  sub-indexes (for example one per category) rather than list every page.

The index MAY be written by hand, by the LLM, or generated from frontmatter.

## 6. Connecting KBs to a project

A project lists its KBs in `.openshelf/kbs.yaml`:

```yaml
openshelf: "0.1"
kbs:
  - id: awesome-can-bus
    source: github:hexsecs/awesome-can-bus   # github:owner/repo, git URL, or local path
    ref: main                                # branch, tag or commit
    path: .                                  # OPTIONAL, subdirectory holding kb.yaml
    use: when the task involves CAN tooling  # OPTIONAL, hint shown with the L0 text
```

The `id` MUST match the KB's own `kb.yaml` id. KB ids MUST be unique within a
project.

A tool (CLI, MCP server or agent hook) then:

1. Fetches each KB into `.openshelf/cache/<id>/` (gitignored), pinned in
   `.openshelf/kbs.lock`.
2. Writes `.openshelf/context.md`: one block per KB with its L0 text, the `use`
   hint, and the resolved path of its index.
3. The project's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` includes or links
   `.openshelf/context.md`, so the agent always sees L0 for every KB and knows
   how to go deeper.

Connected KBs are read-only from the project's side. Knowledge gained while
working on the project goes back to a KB through that KB's own maintenance
process, in its own repository.

Projects MAY connect a KB as a git submodule or plain directory instead; the
cache is just the default.

Schema: [`schemas/project.schema.json`](schemas/project.schema.json).

# Part II — Conventions

Nothing in this part is required for compatibility.

## 7. Default layout

This layout follows the gist's three layers, and is what the `layout`
defaults point to:

```
my-kb/
├── kb.yaml          manifest
├── AGENTS.md        schema: conventions and workflows for the maintainer LLM
├── index.md         catalog of pages
├── log.md           append-only activity log
├── wiki/            LLM-maintained pages
└── raw/             immutable sources; raw/assets/ for images
```

| Gist layer  | Default location | Notes                                               |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Raw sources | `raw/`           | The LLM reads but never modifies them. They MAY live outside the KB (cited by URL) when they can't be redistributed. |
| Wiki        | `wiki/`, `index.md`, `log.md` | Written by the LLM, read by people.    |
| Schema      | `AGENTS.md`      | `CLAUDE.md` works too. Co-evolved by human and LLM. |

Inside `wiki/`, a flat directory is simplest. Larger KBs often use
`wiki/entities/`, `wiki/concepts/` and so on; ids then include the folder.

## 8. Maintenance

### 8.1 Operations

The gist defines three operations. A KB's schema file describes how it runs
them, and SHOULD use these names so tools can trigger them:

| Operation | Input                    | Typical effect |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|
| `ingest`  | a source (file/URL/text) | Keep it in sources if allowed; write a `source` page; update every affected page (one source often touches 10–15); update the index; log it. One at a time with the human reviewing, or in batches. |
| `query`   | a question               | Read the index, then relevant pages, then sources if needed; answer with citations. File useful answers back as `answer` pages, so explorations compound. |
| `lint`    | —                        | Check the contract (§2–§5), contradictions, stale claims, orphan and unreachable pages, missing concept pages, missing cross-references, broken links, budgets, and gaps worth filling. |

### 8.2 Core page types

From the gist, plus `answer`:

| `type`       | Purpose                                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `overview`   | Overview of the KB or a large area of it                       |
| `source`     | Summary of one raw source                                      |
| `entity`     | A concrete thing: tool, person, organization, product, paper   |
| `concept`    | An idea, technique or term                                     |
| `comparison` | Side-by-side of several entities or concepts                   |
| `synthesis`  | Conclusions drawn across many sources                          |
| `answer`     | A query answer filed back into the KB                          |

### 8.3 Log format

The gist suggests a heading per entry, so the log can be parsed with standard
Unix tools:

```markdown
## [2026-10-31] ingest | python-can PyPI page
Created python-can; updated socketcan and the index.
```

### 8.4 Content

- State contradictions between sources on the page instead of silently
  picking one.
- Mark claims no source backs, e.g. `(unverified)`.
- Split pages that outgrow the L2 budget.

### 8.5 Tooling

The format needs nothing beyond an LLM agent and a text editor. The gist
suggests:

- **Search** once the index alone isn't enough, for example
  [qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) (hybrid BM25/vector search, CLI and MCP)
  or a small custom script.
- **Obsidian** for reading (graph view shows hubs and orphans), Obsidian Web
  Clipper for turning articles into Markdown sources, and Dataview for
  querying frontmatter.
- **git** for history and collaboration.

## 9. Profiles

A profile is a named set of extra rules for a common kind of KB. A KB opts in
with `profile:` in `kb.yaml`. Opting in makes the profile's rules binding for
that KB, so tools can rely on them; the contract in Part I is unchanged.

### 9.1 `wiki` (default)

No extra rules.

### 9.2 `awesome` — replacing awesome lists

Each listed item is a page with `type: entity`, which MUST also have:

```yaml
url: https://github.com/...    # the thing being listed
category: Libraries            # used to group the index
```

and SHOULD have:

```yaml
license: MIT                   # SPDX id of the thing being listed
status: active                 # active | maintenance | archived | unknown
last_checked: 2026-10-31       # when url and status were last verified
```

The index groups entities by `category`, one line each with the summary, so
it still reads as a classic awesome list. What this adds over a flat list:

- Each entry has an LLM-written summary, comparison links and sources.
- Adding an entry is an `ingest`: a contributor submits a URL, the
  maintainer LLM writes or updates the page, links it to related entries and
  updates the index.
- `lint` rechecks `url`, `status` and `last_checked`, and flags dead or
  archived entries.

## 10. Versioning

This spec uses `openshelf: "<major>.<minor>"`. Before 1.0, minor versions may
break compatibility.
