python-can gives Python code one API for CAN hardware. Each backend
(`interface=`) maps to a driver or OS facility; on Linux the usual choice is
[SocketCAN](socketcan.md).

It handles the transport only. To turn raw frames into named signals, pair it
with a database decoder such as [cantools](cantools.md).
