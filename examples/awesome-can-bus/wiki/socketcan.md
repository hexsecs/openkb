SocketCAN puts CAN controllers behind the standard Linux networking model:
interfaces show up as `can0`, `vcan0` and so on, are configured with `ip link`,
and are read and written through sockets. A virtual `vcan` interface is handy
for testing without hardware.

Libraries such as [python-can](python-can.md) use it as their Linux backend.
